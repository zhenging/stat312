### 4. HT on Independence
A random sample of `200` married men, all retired, were classified according to education level and number of children:
|        | > | Number of Children |  | Total |
|--------|-- |--------------------|--|-------|
| **Education** | 0-1 | 2-3 | Over 3 | / |
| Elementary | 14 | 37 | 32 | **83** |
| Secondary | 19 | 42 | 17 | **68** |
| College | 12 | 17 | 10 | **39** |
| **Total** | **45** | **96** | **59**| **200** |

Test the hypothesis, at the `0.05` level, that the size of a family is independent of the level of education attained by the father. Be sure to show a table of expected counts and how you calculate your test statistic value.

#### Research Question
Is the size of family independent of the level of education attained by the father?

+ **Population of Interest**: We are not told any information about these participants so we can not justify a particular population.

#### Perspective
All tests on Independence are set up the same way. Only the data differs. There are no population parameters to be defined.

#### Data Collection
We do assume a random sample for this HT. Data is collected for each observation unit for two categorical variables and create a contingency table as above.
Sample size: $n = 200$

#### State $H_0 \& H_A$
$H_0$: The size of family **is independent** of the education level of the father.
$H_A$: The size of family **is not independent** of the education level of the father.

#### Choose $\alpha$
Use the standard value of $\alpha = 0.05$

#### Define test statistic & distribution
Interpret the contingency table:
Let $L_0, L_1, L_2$ denote three edcation level. For a randomly selected father
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(L_0) = \frac{83}{200}, \space P(L_1) = \frac{68}{200}, \space P(L_2) = \frac{39}{200}
\end{aligned}
$$
Let $N_0, N_1, N_2$ denote the three numbers of children
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(N_0) = \frac{45}{200}, \space P(N_1) = \frac{96}{200}, \space P(N_2) = \frac{59}{200}
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $O_{ij}$ be the count of man with education level of $i$ and number of children of $j$.
Assuming $H_0$ is true, we calculate the number of cases we expect to see in each cell of the table.
$$
\begin{aligned}
E_{ij} &= n * (\frac{\text{total count in row i}}{n}) * (\frac{\text{total count in column j}}{n})\\
&= \frac{\text{(total count in row i)} * \text{(total count in column j)}}{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

Expected Counts:
|        | > | Number of Children |  |
|--------|-- |--------------------|--|
| **Education** | 0-1 | 2-3 | Over 3 |
| Elementary | 18.675 | 39.840 | 24.485 |
| Secondary | 17.550 | 37.440 | 23.010 |
| College | 8.7750 | 18.720 | 11.505 |

Test Statistic is $\Chi^2$ (chi-squared)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Chi_0^2 &\text{\textasciitilde} \Chi_v^2\\
v &= (\text{No. of rows} - 1)* (\text{No. of columns} - 1)\\
&= 2 * 2 = 4\\
\chi_0^2  &= \Sigma_i \Sigma_j \frac{(O{ij-E_{ij}})^2}{E_{ij}}\\
&\approx 7.46439
\end{aligned}
$$
> Expected Counts and $\chi_0^2$ are calculated with Ti 83+. See end of the document for steps.

#### Calculate `p-value`
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{p-value} &= P\{\text{get our value or more extreme } \space | \space H_0 \text{ is true}\}\\
&= P(\Chi_0^2 > 7.46439 \space | \space \text{Independence})\\
&= \Chi^2\text{cdf}(\text{Lower bound}, \text{Upper bound}, \text{Degree of freedom})\\
&= \Chi^2\text{cdf}(7.46439, 999, 4)\\
&\approx 0.11329
\end{aligned}
$$

##### Using Base R
```
elementary = c(14, 37, 32)
secondary = c(19, 42, 17)
college = c(12, 17, 10)
M = as.table(rbind(elementary, secondary, college))
dimnames(M) = list("Education" = c("Elementary", "Secondary", "College"),
  "Number of Children" = c("0-1", "2-3", "Over 3"))

Xsq = chisq.test(M)
print("Observed Counts")
Xsq$observed
print("Expected Counts")
Xsq$expected

#### Draw Conclusion
$\text{p-value} = 0.11329 > 0.05 = \alpha$
$\therefore$ **Fail** to Reject $H_0$.

#### State conclusion in context
This data **does not provide** evidence that the family size is **not independent** of the education level of the father.
