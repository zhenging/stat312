### 4. HT on Independence
A random sample of `200` married men, all retired, were classified according to education level and number of children:
| | > | Number of Children ||
|----|----|----|-------|
**Education** | 0-1 | 2-3 | Over 3
Elementary | 14 | 37 | 32
Secondary | 19 | 42 | 17
College | 12 | 17 | 10

Test the hypothesis, at the `0.05` level, that the size of a family is independent of the level of education attained by the father. Be sure to show a table of expected counts and how you calculate your test statistic value.
