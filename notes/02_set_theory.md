## 02 Set Theory

### Statistics Versus/and/or Probability
1\. Clear box VS. Covered Box
+ Clear: We have the model for a situation and we calculate change of outcomes => probability
+ Covered: We have some outcomes/data and we generate a model => statistics

2\. **Probability**: Chance of outcomes of action in the future
+ Experiment: set of actions => record something
+ Random Variable: variable with unknown future value
+ Probability: long-run fraction of times random variable has value $x$.

3\. **Statistics**: Set of data used to make claims or model relationships
+ Summarize and describe data
+ Support a claim about a population using the data
+ Predict value of one variable as a function of a set of other variables.

### Plan for the Quarter
1. Learn basic probability models
2. Summarize and describe data sets
3. Hypothesis Testing
4. Linear Regression
5. ANOVA and Quality Control

### Fundamental Set Theory Operations
+ Union
  - Put two sets together (binary operator)
  - Denoted with U => $A \cup B$

+ Intersection
  - The object that two sets have in common
  - Denoted with $\cap$ => $A \cap B$

+ Complement
  - The objects in $\omega$ that are not in the set $A$ (unitary operator)
  - Denoted with subscript of $A^c$
