### 3. Summarizing HTs and CIs on Population Parameters
Construct a comparison to summarize the 3 types of hypothesis tests on population parameters that we have learned. For all 3 types, include
1) the formal name of the HT,
2) the population parameter name and symbol,
3) the list of assumptions made,
4) the test statistic and what it represents,
5) the distribution of the test statistic,
6) an example sketch of the distribution of the test statistic and the H0 that corresponds to it,
7) instructions on how to do the HT on your calculator,
8) the formula for the corresponding CI, and
9) instructions on how to do the CI on your calculator.
