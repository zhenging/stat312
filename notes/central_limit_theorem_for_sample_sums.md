### Central Limit Theorem For Sample Sums
Suppose $X$ is a random variable with a distribution that may be **known or unknow** (it can be any distribution). Using a subscript that matches the random variable, suppose:
a. $\mu_X = $ the mean of $X$
b. $\sigma_X = $ the standard deviation of $X$.

If you draw random sample of sizes $n$, then as $n$ increase, the random variable $\Sigma {X}$ consisting of sums tends to be **normally distributed** and
$\Sigma {X} \text{\textasciitilde} N((n)(\mu_x), (\sqrt{n})(\sigma_X))$

+ **Sampling distribution of the mean** - the distribution of the random variable $\bar{X}$, which consist of sample means
+ As the sample size $n$ increases, the **sampling distribution of the mean** approaches a normal distribution.
