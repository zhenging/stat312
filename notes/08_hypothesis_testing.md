### 08 Hypothesis
**Purpose**
The purpose of a hypothesistst is to decide which of two mutally exclusive and spanning staments is supported by a given data set.

$H_0$ is called the null hypothesis. $H_A$ is called the alternative hypothesis.

Different types of hypothesis tests
1\. HTs on population parameters
+ population proportion
+ population mean
+ difference in two population means

2\. HT on independence of RVsgi

3\. Goodness-of-Fit HT for categorical data


To perform a hypothesis test, a statistician will
1. Set up two contradictory hypotheses.
2. Collect sample data
3. Determine the correct distribution to perform **HT**.
4. Analyze sample data by performing the calculations that ultimately will allow to reject or decline to reject the null hypothesis.
5. Make a decision and write a meaningful conclusion.

#### Null and Alternative Hypothesis

ACTION	| $H_0$ IS ACTUALLY	| ...
--------|-----------------|-----------
  | True	| False
Do not reject $H_0$ |	Correct Outcome |	Type II error
Reject $H_0$	| Type I Error	| Correct Outcome


##### Example
Suppose the null hypothesis, $H_0$, is: Frank's rock climbing equipment is safe.

**Type I error:** Frank thinks that his rock climbing equipment may not be safe when, in fact, it really is safe.
**Type II error:** Frank thinks that his rock climbing equipment may be safe when, in fact, it is not safe.

$\alpha$ = probability that Frank thinks his rock climbing equipment may not be safe when, in fact, it really is safe.
$\beta$ = probability that Frank thinks his rock climbing equipment may be safe when, in fact, it is not safe.

Notice that, in this case, the error with the greater consequence is the Type II error. (If Frank thinks his rock climbing equipment is safe, he will go ahead and use it.)
