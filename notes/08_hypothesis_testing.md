## 08 Hypothesis
**Purpose**
The purpose of a hypothesistst is to decide which of two mutally exclusive and spanning staments is supported by a given data set.

$H_0$ is called the **null hypothesis**. $H_A$ is called the **alternative hypothesis.**

1\. HTs on population parameters
+ population proportion
+ population mean
+ difference in two population means

2\. HT on independence of RVsgi

3\. Goodness-of-Fit HT for categorical data


### Steps in a Hypothesis Tests on Population Parameters
+ Determine the reasearch questions
  - population of interest
  - quantity of interest
+ State your perspective
  + What claim are you holding to shout to the world?
  + Define notation for population parameters
+ Data Collection Plan
  + Simple random sampl
  + Sample size
+ Choose $\alpha = 0.5$ (Type I Error)
+ Define test statistic and its distribution
+ Calculate $\text{p-value} = P\{\text{get what you get or something more extreme } | H_0 \text{ is true }\}$
+ Draw conclusion: Reject $H_0$ if $\text{p-value} < \alpha$
+ State conclusion in context

### Null and Alternative Hypothesis

ACTION	| $H_0$ IS ACTUALLY	| $H_0$ IS NOT ACTUALLY
--------|-----------------|-----------
|   | True	| False
Do not reject $H_0$ |	Correct Outcome |	Type II error
Reject $H_0$	| Type I Error	| Correct Outcome


##### Example
Suppose the null hypothesis, $H_0$, is: Frank's rock climbing equipment is safe.

**Type I error:** Frank thinks that his rock climbing equipment may not be safe when, in fact, it really is safe.
**Type II error:** Frank thinks that his rock climbing equipment may be safe when, in fact, it is not safe.

$\alpha$ = probability that Frank thinks his rock climbing equipment may not be safe when, in fact, it really is safe.
$\beta$ = probability that Frank thinks his rock climbing equipment may be safe when, in fact, it is not safe.

Notice that, in this case, the error with the greater consequence is the Type II error. (If Frank thinks his rock climbing equipment is safe, he will go ahead and use it.)
