### Notation
`n` = sample size
`j` is the subscript that denotes the particular one

**Probability VS. Statistics**
$X_j$ - Random Variable (For _probability perspective_)
+ Capital Letter
+ With "Feet"

$x_j$ - Data Value (For _statistics perspective_)

For Example:
Let $X_j$ = height of _jth_ patient in inches, j=1,...,n
$x_j = 64.5$ inches - measuared value subject to measurement error, recording errod, etc.
$X_j$ = height of _4th_ patient (**true value**)

**Population VS. Sample**

| Concept | Population Parameter | Sample Statistic |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|
| mean | $\mu$ | $\bar{x}$ |
| standard deviation | $\sigma$ | $s$ |
| variance | $\sigma^2$ | $s^2$ |
| proportion | $\pi$ | $p$ |

+ The **True value** fo the population parameter is unknown (unless we do a census - collect data from every memeber of the population - in which case, we don't really need to estimate anything).
+ We estimate the value of the population parameter by the sample statistic.
+ Estimate are denoted with "hats", eg. $\hat \mu = \bar{x}$.
+ Seeing $\pi$ as a parameter instead of a number.
