### 05 Data Collection

**Data**
1\. Numberical
+ Continuous
+ Discrete

2\. Categorical
+ Binary
+ Nominal (Unordered Categorical)
+ Ordinal (Ordered Categorical)

#### Binary Data
Binary data are a subset of categorical data, which are used to represent a situation with exactly
two possibilities.

#### Nominal Data
+ An iconic example of a nominal variable is race.
+ If numbers are used to code the categories (instead of names), since numbers are arbitrary, statistics such means and variance are nonsense when applied to this data type.

#### Ordinal Data (Ordered)
+ When data is divided into mutually exclusive catatories that have a direct ordering.
+ An iconic example is Likert-type questions, which ask respondents to indicate their level of agreement with a given statement with ordered options (1 = Strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = Strongle agree)

#### Types of Data and Statistical Judgement
The main decision of whether to conside data as ordinal or continuous is guided by two criteria:
(1) whether or not the mean is an informative statistic
(2) how many categories there are if you use an ordinal value.
