## 05 Data Collection

### Data
1\. Numberical
+ Continuous
+ Discrete

2\. Categorical
+ Binary
+ Nominal (Unordered Categorical)
+ Ordinal (Ordered Categorical)

#### Binary Data
Binary data are a subset of categorical data, which are used to represent a situation with exactly
two possibilities.

#### Nominal Data
+ An iconic example of a nominal variable is race.
+ If numbers are used to code the categories (instead of names), since numbers are arbitrary, statistics such means and variance are nonsense when applied to this data type.

#### Ordinal Data (Ordered)
+ When data is divided into mutually exclusive catatories that have a direct ordering.
+ An iconic example is Likert-type questions, which ask respondents to indicate their level of agreement with a given statement with ordered options (1 = Strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = Strongle agree)

#### Types of Data and Statistical Judgement
The main decision of whether to conside data as ordinal or continuous is guided by two criteria:
(1) whether or not the mean is an informative statistic
(2) how many categories there are if you use an ordinal value.

### Essential Ideas

#### Concepts
+ Population
+ Sample
+ Bias
+ Simple Random Sample
+ Explanatory variable
+ Response variable
+ Observational study
+ Experiment
+ Placebo
+ Randomized experiment
+ Control Group
+ Experimental grou
+ Blind study (and double-blind study)
+ Placebo effect

#### Facts
1. A random sample is not necessarily representative, but usuually is.
2. We can never know if our sample is representative unless we have a censur of the entire population, in which case a sample is unnecessary.
3. Principles of experimental designs.
  + Controlling
  + Randomization
  + Replication
  + Blocking
4. Association does not impley causation
