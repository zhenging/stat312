### Confidence Interval

#### Understanding CI
+ 95% **is NOT** the probablity of anything
+ $\mu$ = true popoluation mean is an unknown constant.
+ Every unique sample generates its own corresponding CI.
+ For any interval `(a, b)`, either $\mu$ is in the interval or it is not.
+ We never know for certain whether $\mu$ is in the CI generated by a particular data set.
+ Our confidence is in the procedure for constructing the CI.

#### Confidence in CI Procedure
+ Choose $\alpha$
  1. Random sample of size n from population of interest
  2. Collect Data
  3. Construct $(1-\alpha)\%$ CI corresponding to this data set.
+ Repeat steps 1-3 many, many times -> approximately $(1-\alpha)\%$ CI contains $\mu$, but we don't know which ones

#### CI Formulas

##### Single Population Mean($\mu$)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\bigg(\bar{x} \pm t^* (\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}})\bigg)
\end{aligned}
$$

+ Difference between Two Population Means ($\mu_1 -\mu_2$)
  - Population variance are unknown and assumed not equal

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bigg((\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}) \pm t^* (\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}})\bigg)
\end{aligned}
$$

##### Single Popluation Proportion ($\pi$)
+ Normal Approximation to $\text{Binomial}(n, \pi)$ (traditional method)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bigg(\hat p \pm z^* \sqrt{\frac{\hat p (1-\hat p)}{n}}\bigg)
\end{aligned}
$$

+ Agresti & Coull (1998) improvement to traditional method:  Add 2 to both the number of success and the number of failures, then use the traditional approach (note that n becomes `n + 4` and sample proportion becomes `(c+2)/(n+4)`

+ Wilson Score Interval(1927) - improvement for smaller n values
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\hat p + \frac{z^2}{2n}}{1 + \frac{z^2}{n}} \pm \frac{z}{1 + \frac{z^2}{n}} \sqrt{\frac{\hat p (1-\hat p)}{n} + \frac{z^2}{4n^2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### CI connection to HT
+ CI are "reasonable values" for the population parameter
+ A two-sided HT will fail to reject $H_0$ if $\mu_0$ is reasonable for that data set.
+ If $\mu_0$ is in the corresponding $(1-\alpha)\%$ CI, then the HT will fail to reject $H_0$.
