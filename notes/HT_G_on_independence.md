## Hypothesis Test on Independence

### Example G
In a study a hypertension and smoking habits, participants were categorized as non-smokers, moderate smokers, or heavy smokers and tests were run to decide if they have hypertension or not? The data is summmarized below. Are the variables independent?
|   | Non-smokers | Moderate Smokers | Heavy Smokers | Totals |
|---|-------------|------------------|---------------|--------|
| Hypertension    | 21 | 36 | 30 | 87 |
| No Hypertension | 48 | 26 | 19 | 93 |
| Totals          | 69 | 62 | 49 | 180 |

#### Research Question
Is hypertension independent of smoking status?
> Remember: $P(A \cup) B = P(A) * P(B)$

+ **Population of Interest**: We are not told any information about these participants so we can not justify a particular population.

> Like many textbook problems, there is very little context given for this data; however, we can still use it to learn the process.

#### Perspective
All tests on Independence are set up the same way. Only the data differs.
There are no population parameters to be defined.

#### Data Collection
We do assume a random sample for this HT. Data is collected for each observation unit for two categorical variables and create a contingency table as above.
Sample size: $n = 180$

#### State $H_0 \& H_A$
$H_0$: Smoking status and hypertension are independent.
$H_A$: Smoking status and hypertension are **Not** independent.

#### Choose $\alpha$
Use the standard value of $\alpha = 0.05$

#### Define test statistic & distribution
Interpret the contingency table:
Let $H$ denote person has hypertension. For a randomly selected person
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(H) = \frac{87}{180}\\
P(H^C) = \frac{93}{180}\\
\end{aligned}
$$
Let $S_0, S_1, S_2$ denote the three smoky statues.
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(S_0) = \frac{69}{180}\\
P(S_1) = \frac{62}{180}\\
P(S_2) = \frac{49}{180}
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $O_{ij}$ be the count of person with hypertension level of $i$ and smoking status of $j$.
Assuming $H_0$ is true, we calculate the number of cases we expect to see in each cell of the table.
$$
\begin{aligned}
E_{ij} = n * \frac{}{}
\end{aligned}
$$

> **Assume $H_0$ is true**
